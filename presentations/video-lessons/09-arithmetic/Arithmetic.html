<strong>Slide 1 - Arithmetic:</strong><br>
Let's learn about Arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 2 - Purpose:</strong><br>
In some ways, computers are just large machines for doing arithmetic.
Computers are very, very good at doing math.
In fact, modern computers can perform billions or even trillions of calculations per second.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 3 - Operators:</strong><br>
There are six basic mathematical operators in Python that you should be familiar with: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponentiation, and Modulo.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 4 - Addition and Subtraction:</strong><br>
The plus sign (+) and minus sign (-) are used for addition and subtraction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 5 - Multiplication and Exponentiation:</strong><br>
One asterisk (*) is used for multiplication.
Two asterisks (**) are used for exponents (also known as powers).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 6 - Division:</strong><br>
The forward slash is used for division.
When you divide two integers, you will always get a floating point number.
I'll say that 
again - 
whenever you do division, the result will always be a float!
Keep in mind, you cannot divide by 0!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 7 - Modulo:</strong><br>
You have probably never heard of the Modulo operator, but it's simple: it calculates the remainder.
Modulo is sometimes called "Clock Arithmetic", because it makes it easy to figure out time.
If someone said "It is 1600 hours", you could do "16 modulo 12" and find out they meant "4pm".
However, modulo has many other uses, such as for figuring out if numbers are even or odd.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 8 - Using the Operators:</strong><br>
When you run a program with operators, Python will do the math and then replace the result.
You will not be able to see the computer do the math by looking at just the code!
Notice the difference between the code on the left, and the actual actions that occur on the right.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Slide 9 - Order of Operations:</strong><br>
When you use operators, there is an order of operations.
Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Modulo, Division, Addition, Subtraction.
Whenever there's a tie, the left-most operation happens first.
Notice that you can always override any ordering by using parentheses.
You might already be familiar with this order: if not, here is a useful mnemonic:
Please Excuse My Most Dear Aunt Sally.
