# Course Setup

This section breaks down precisely what must be done each semester to get a new instance running.

## 1 - Prepare Canvas

- [ ] Crosslist any additional sections: If you are teaching more than one section, we recommend you cross-list them so that you only need to be editing one course instance. [Instructions are provided](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10885-4214719646) by Canvas.

- [ ] Import most recent version of canvas course: You can find the most recent version of the Sneks curriculum from here (you will need to contact the course developers for the password). [Instructions are provided](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-12783-415241324) by Canvas.

- [ ] Fix LTI configurations (update visibility to be public, fix shared secret and key)

	- [ ] BlockPy: Consumer key and shared secret are [here](https://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy/courses/add_canvas). No further configuration is necessary if you are leaving the assignments unchanged.

	- [ ] Web-CAT: You will need to contact the Web-CAT admins to get your course set up on the Web-CAT system. Instructions for pairing assignments are given [here](http://web-cat.org/wiki/lti-configuration-instructions). If you have taught the course previously, you should be able to reuse the assignments from previous semesters; otherwise you will need to configure the assignments yourself with the provided unit tests.

- [ ] Setup Piazza: visit the Piazza tab and step through the options

- [ ] Update Syllabus: The syllabus is a Page, but is accessible through the left side navigation.

- [ ] Establish Open/Due/Lock Dates: If you have multiple sections, we recommend this [tool](https://github.com/acbart/canvas-grading-reports) (requires some very light command line expertise, Python). If you do not, then you can use this [tool](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-8585-adjust-all-assignment-dates-on-one-page) (all done via Google Sheets).

- [ ] Publish Canvas course

- [ ] Make an announcement to students: Introduce yourself and explain how to access the Canvas course.

## 2 - Organize Course Staff

- [ ] Send introductory email to staff: Introduce yourself to the TAs and let them know your expectations.

    - [ ] Arrange staff meeting: You should choose a common time period to meet with the TAs. We recommend weekly meetings. It can be difficult to schedule all the TAs for a single meeting, so you might want to schedule two time slots.

    - [ ] Arrange office hours: Solicit timeslots from the TAs for their office hours. Two strategies we have used: give them a spreadsheet and have the TAs sign up for times, or collect all the hours and assign timeslots yourself.

- [ ] Enroll TAs in Canvas course

- [ ] Update course staff page

- [ ] Enroll TAs in Staff Mailing List (e.g., through Google Groups)

## 3 - Visit Classroom

- [ ] Check out the physical room you'll be teaching in, to make sure it will work for your purposes.
