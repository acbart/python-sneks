CS1

CMU 15-112
----------

* Link: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/)
* A considerable amount of open material including lecture slides, video lessons, and programming assignments.

Georgia Tech
------------

* Link: [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/online-cs1301](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/online-cs1301)
* "CS 1301: Introduction to Computing using Python is Georgia Tech's first class in undergraduate computer science. The online version (CS 1301 O1) replicates the content of the on-campus course while taking advantage of the online medium and being highly interactive. The course is broken up into three components: the content structure, the course topics, and the delivery style. First, the course delineates the content into three domains: foundational computing principles, taught in a programming language-neutral way; programming concepts in python that demonstrate those computing principles; and domain applications that use those concepts and principles in real applications. Second, the course's four main topics: computing foundations, procedural programming, control structures and data structures, plus a preview of the next topics of the program's next two classes. Third, the course builds on a custom textbook written for the class and online course delivery, with each providing ample interaction and formative evaluation. In this way, the class teaches both the theory and implementation of core computing concepts in a highly interactive, multi-modal manner."

Single Context Approaches
=========================

Media Computation
-----------------

* Link: [http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/mediaComp-teach](http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/mediaComp-teach)
* "A contextualized approach to introducing computing using a ubiquitous theme of manipulating media. The critical characteristic of MediaComp is that students create expressive media by manipulating computational materials (like arrays and linked lists) at a lower-level of abstraction. Students manipulate images by changing pixels, create sounds by iterating over samples, render linked lists into music, and create artifacts like collages, music, and digital video special effects. In so doing, the students learn computation."
* Currrently, it seems like there are [no plans to make Media Comp libraries available for Python 3](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2016/08/19/where-are-the-python-3-libraries-for-media-computation/).

Earsketch
---------

* Link: [https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/)
* "EarSketch helps you learn coding through music. Use sounds from the EarSketch library or your own sounds, along with Python or JavaScript code, to produce studio quality music."

Non-Computing Majors
====================

CT @ VT
-------
* Link: [https://think.cs.vt.edu/course_materials/](https://think.cs.vt.edu/course_materials/)
* "An introductory computing course aimed at non-computing majors who have no prior computing experience. The course emphasizes a few major topics in computing: Algorithms, Abstractions, and Social Impacts. The entire experience is contextualized through real-world data science, to maximize students' perception of the authenticity of the learning experience. Although the course teaches some basic programming, the curriculum goes beyond coding to attempt to teach computational thinking."
* Covers a limited subset of a typical CS1, and does not have much assessment.
