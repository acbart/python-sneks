# The PythonSneks Teaching Field Guide

An introductory curriculum for learning Python, built following Instructional Design principles. The materials of the course are meant to be open-source and evaluated, in the hopes of establishing a baseline introductory level course. The target audience is explicitly undergraduate students in a university setting who are not computing majors, but are in STEM.

# The Canvas Site

The materials here are destined for a Canvas site. Materials are synchronized using [Waltz](https://github.com/acbart/waltz) (well, they are in Version 2; in Version 1 we had a more ad-hoc script, but eventually pulled the "final" versions using Waltz).

# Credit

A number of people have been involved and should be recognized:

* Cory Bart is the project leader - he made a lot of stuff and is very tired.
* Larry Cox is the instructional designer and has been invaluable for both curriculum development, paper writing, and project planning.
* Allie Sarver was an undergraduate research assistant and did some awesome research on how we used peer learning in the course.
* Michael Friend was an undergraduate research assistant and did some awesome research on the effect of worked examples on student learning.
* Panagiotis Apostolellis taught with the curriculum in Spring 2018, giving both valuable feedback and BEAUTIFUL slides.
* Cal Ribbens spearheaded the funding for a grant from TLOS and was responsible for starting this effort.
* TLOS gave us lot's of money and guidance to rebuild the course.
